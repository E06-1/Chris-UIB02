  <h1>Nina Simone - Baltimore</h1>

  <p>
    Beat-up little seagull On a marble stair Tryna find the ocean Lookin'
    everywhere Hard times in the city In a hard town by the sea Ain't nowhere to
    run to There ain't nothin' here for free Waiting for a train Drunk, lying on
    the sidewalk Sleeping in the rain And the people hide their faces And they
    hide their eyes 'Cause the city's dyin' And they don't know why Oh,
    Baltimore Ain't it hard just to live? Oh, Baltimore Ain't it hard just to
    live? Just to live Get my sister Sandy And my little brother Ray Buy a big
    old wagon To haul us all away Live out in the country Where the mountain's
    high Never gonna come back here 'Til the day I die Oh, Baltimore Ain't it
    hard just to live? Oh, Baltimore Ain't it hard just to live? Just to live
